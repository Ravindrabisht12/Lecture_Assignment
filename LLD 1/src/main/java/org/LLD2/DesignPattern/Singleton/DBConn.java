/**
 * Design Patterns:
 * A design pattern is a proven, reusable solution to a common software design problem.
 * Patterns provide templates for solving recurring design challenges in a given context.
 *
 * Singleton Design Pattern:
 * Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
 *
 * Types of Design Patterns:
 * 1. Creational: Object creation mechanisms (Singleton, Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype)
 * 2. Structural: Object composition/structure (Adapter, Composite, Proxy, Flyweight, Facade, Bridge, Decorator)
 * 3. Behavioral: Object interaction/responsibility (Observer, Strategy, Command, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, State, Template Method, Visitor)

    // Eager initialization Singleton (Simple and Safe):
    //
    // This approach creates the Singleton instance when the class is loaded, before any method is called.
    // It's the simplest way to guarantee thread safety, since the JVM handles class loading in a thread-safe manner.
    // However, it always creates the instance, even if it's never used, which can waste resources for heavy objects.
    //
    // Key learning points:
    // - No synchronization needed; thread safety is automatic.
    // - Use when the Singleton is lightweight and always needed.
    // - Not suitable for lazy loading or expensive objects.
    //
    // Example:
    // private static final DBConn INSTANCE_EAGER = new DBConn();

     * could create multiple instances if they call this method at the same time.

     * - Good for learning the basic idea of lazy loading.
     * - Not thread-safe; avoid in concurrent applications.
     * - Shows why thread safety is important for Singletons.

     * if the method is called frequently after the instance is created.

     * Key learning points:
     * - Simple way to add thread safety to lazy initialization.

     * - Use 'volatile' for the instance variable to prevent instruction reordering issues.
     * - Locking is only performed when necessary, improving performance.

     * - Synchronized blocks are more efficient than synchronizing the whole method.
