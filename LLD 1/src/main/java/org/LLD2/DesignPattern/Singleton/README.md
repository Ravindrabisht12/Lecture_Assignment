# Singleton Design Pattern - Learning Guide

## What is the Singleton Pattern?
The Singleton pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

## When to Use It
- When you need exactly one instance of a class to coordinate actions across the system (e.g., configuration, logging, database connection).
- When you want to control access to shared resources.

## How It Works
- The class has a private constructor to prevent external instantiation.
- A static method provides access to the single instance, creating it if necessary.
- Thread safety can be ensured using various techniques (eager, lazy, synchronized, double-checked locking).

## Example Usage
```java
DBConn dbConn = DBConn.getInstanceSynchronizedBlock();
```

## Key Benefits
- Controlled access to sole instance.
- Reduced memory footprint for shared resources.
- Centralized management of global state.

## Try It Yourself
- Experiment with different Singleton implementations (eager, lazy, synchronized).
- Try using Singleton for logging or configuration management.
