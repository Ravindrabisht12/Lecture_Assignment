# Factory Design Pattern - Learning Guide

## What is the Factory Pattern?
The Factory pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

## When to Use It
- When you need to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.
- When you want to delegate the responsibility of instantiation to child classes.
- When you have a family of related classes and want to centralize object creation.

## How It Works
- The Factory defines a method for creating objects, which subclasses override to specify the type of object to create.
- The client code calls the factory method instead of using constructors directly.

## Example Usage
```java
UIFactory factory = new FlutterFactory();
UI button = factory.createButton();
button.render();
```

## Key Benefits
- Promotes loose coupling by eliminating the need to bind application-specific classes into code.
- Centralizes object creation logic.
- Makes code more flexible and extensible.

## Try It Yourself
- Add new UI types and factories to see how easy it is to extend the system.
- Experiment with switching factories at runtime.
