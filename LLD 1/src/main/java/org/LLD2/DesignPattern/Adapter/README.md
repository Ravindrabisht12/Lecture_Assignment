# Adapter Design Pattern - Learning Guide

## What is the Adapter Pattern?
The Adapter pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two interfaces, enabling code reuse and flexibility.

## When to Use It
- When you want to use an existing class, but its interface does not match what you need.
- When you need to integrate code from different libraries or systems.
- When you want to make unrelated classes work together without modifying their source code.

## How It Works
- The Adapter wraps an existing class and translates its interface into one that the client expects.
- The client interacts with the adapter, which delegates calls to the adaptee (the original class).

## Example Usage
```java
BankAPI iciciAdapter = new ICICIBankAPIAdapter();
PhonePe phonePe = new PhonePe(iciciAdapter);
phonePe.transferMoney();
```

## Key Benefits
- Promotes code reuse by allowing integration of existing classes.
- Decouples client code from specific implementations.
- Makes code more flexible and maintainable.

## Try It Yourself
- Create adapters for different banks and see how PhonePe can work with all of them.
- Experiment with adapting third-party libraries to your own interfaces.
